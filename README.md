# My favourite city Barcelona, in pictures

This is a project with vanilla JS. The central feature is a carrousel of photographs from the city of Barcelona. No Bootstrap is used for this.

The current Barcelona weather is included, using the weather.io api. The current Barcelona time is included as well, based on the JS time and date method.
